# NoSQL and MongoDB Project

## Project Overview

This project is focused on understanding the concepts and practical applications of NoSQL databases, with a particular emphasis on MongoDB. The resources and tasks provided helped me learn about the fundamental differences between SQL and NoSQL, the benefits of using NoSQL databases, and how to effectively interact with MongoDB using the Mongo shell and Python.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, I was able to:

1. **Understand NoSQL**:
   - Explain what NoSQL means and its significance in the context of modern databases.
   - Identify the differences between SQL and NoSQL databases.
   - Understand the concept of ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) and how it applies to databases.

2. **Document Storage**:
   - Describe what a document storage database is and how it differs from other types of databases.

3. **Types of NoSQL Databases**:
   - List and describe different types of NoSQL databases such as document stores, key-value stores, wide-column stores, and graph databases.

4. **Benefits of NoSQL**:
   - Articulate the benefits of using a NoSQL database, including scalability, flexibility, and performance advantages.

5. **Querying NoSQL Databases**:
   - Demonstrate how to query information from a NoSQL database using MongoDB.

6. **Inserting, Updating, and Deleting Data**:
   - Perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations in MongoDB.

7. **Using MongoDB**:
   - Utilize MongoDB and its shell (`mongosh`) to manage and manipulate data.
   - Integrate MongoDB with Python to interact with the database programmatically.

## Resources

The following resources were instrumental in helping me achieve the learning objectives:

1. **NoSQL Databases Explained**: This resource provided a comprehensive overview of what NoSQL databases are and how they differ from traditional SQL databases.

2. **What is NoSQL?**: A deeper dive into the types of NoSQL databases, their use cases, and their benefits.

3. **MongoDB with Python Crash Course - Tutorial for Beginners**: This tutorial helped me understand how to use Python to interact with MongoDB, covering the basics of connecting to the database, performing CRUD operations, and using MongoDB's powerful query language.

4. **MongoDB Tutorial 2: Insert, Update, Remove, Query**: This hands-on tutorial guided me through the essential operations in MongoDB, providing practical examples of how to manipulate data.

5. **Aggregation**: This resource introduced me to MongoDB's aggregation framework, which allows for more complex data processing and querying.

6. **Introduction to MongoDB and Python**: An introductory guide to integrating MongoDB with Python, which was crucial for understanding how to build applications that interact with MongoDB.

7. **mongo Shell Methods**: This resource helped me learn about various commands and methods available in the MongoDB shell, which is essential for database management.

8. **Mongosh Learning Objectives**: A guide to understanding and mastering the MongoDB shell (`mongosh`), which is the primary interface for interacting with MongoDB from the command line.

## Usage

To run the MongoDB command files in this project, use the following steps:

1. Start the MongoDB server:
   ```bash
   sudo service mongod start
   ```

2. Access the MongoDB shell:
   ```bash
   mongosh
   ```

3. Run your MongoDB commands by loading the command files:
   ```javascript
   load("filename.js");
   ```

## Conclusion

This project provided a solid foundation in NoSQL databases, particularly MongoDB. The resources were invaluable in guiding me through the learning process, and the practical tasks helped cement my understanding of the key concepts.
