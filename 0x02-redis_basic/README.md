# Redis Basics and Python Integration

## Overview

This repository contains my learning journey with Redis, focusing on basic operations and its integration with Python. The goal was to understand how Redis works as a data structure store, how to perform basic operations, and how to use Redis as a simple caching mechanism with Python.

## Learning Objectives

- **Understand the Basics of Redis:** Learn about Redis and its core functionalities, including basic commands and data types.
- **Perform Basic Redis Operations:** Explore how to perform operations such as setting and getting values, working with hashes, lists, sets, and more.
- **Integrate Redis with Python:** Learn how to interact with Redis using Python, including connecting to a Redis server, executing commands, and handling data.
- **Use Redis as a Simple Cache:** Implement a simple caching mechanism using Redis to optimize data retrieval in Python applications.

## Resources

During this learning process, I found the following resources particularly helpful:

1. **[Redis Crash Course Tutorial](https://example.com)**: This tutorial provided a solid introduction to Redis, covering installation, configuration, and basic operations.
   
2. **[Redis Commands Documentation](https://redis.io/commands)**: The official Redis commands documentation is an excellent reference for understanding the various commands available in Redis and their usage.
   
3. **[Redis Python Client Documentation](https://pypi.org/project/redis/)**: This resource guided me through the process of integrating Redis with Python using the `redis-py` library.
   
4. **[How to Use Redis With Python](https://realpython.com/python-redis/)**: A comprehensive guide on using Redis with Python, including practical examples of setting up a Redis server, interacting with it, and implementing caching mechanisms.

## Contents

- **Basic Redis Commands**: Examples of setting, getting, and deleting keys, working with different data types, and more.
- **Redis Python Integration**: Code snippets demonstrating how to connect to Redis from Python, execute commands, and handle responses.
- **Simple Caching with Redis**: A Python script that implements a basic caching mechanism using Redis.

## Getting Started

To run the examples in this repository, you'll need to have Redis installed on your machine, along with Python and the `redis-py` client library.

### Prerequisites
